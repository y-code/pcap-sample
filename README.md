# Sniffy - PCAP Sandbox

## Network Traffic Visualization with Three.js

This is a visualization of network traffic.

Monitoring network packets, the Sniffy tool aggregates the data to see communications between endpoints by protocol.

Every network endpoint in the diagram has an IP address and communication protocols are connected in thick lines. The protocols are displayed with their significant port number.
